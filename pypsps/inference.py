    Counterfactual predictions can be obtained by setting treatment values

        Pr(Y | X, do(T))

    E.g., for binary treatment, the pypsps model can be used to switch between
    factual (observed) and counter-factual (unobserved) predictions.  This usually
    gets accomplished by setting treatment == 0 (or == 1) for all observations.

    Args:
      model: a trained pypsps model.
      features: features (X) for the causal model. Often a
        pd.DataFrame/np.ndarray, but can also be non-standard
        data structure as long as the pypsps model can use it as
        input to model.predict([features, ...]).
